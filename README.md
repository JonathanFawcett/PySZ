# Introduction
This is a modular, extensible, and verifiable open-source Python package capable of calculating the expected power spectrum, bispectrum, and higher-order statistics of the thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect for cosmological structures, including clusters and filaments. For a full description of the cosmology and mathematics behind this, see [PySZ-Thesis.pdf](/PySZ-Thesis.pdf).

# Usage
Install required packages with `pip install -r requirements.txt`, and run [CreatePosterPlots.py](/CreatePosterPlots.py) to generate example plots for clusters and filaments of various orientations. Unit tests are available in the [test](/test/) folder to demonstrate the validity of each class.
